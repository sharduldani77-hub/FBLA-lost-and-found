   <p> Months ago, at the beginning of October, we joined to form the FBLA team responsible for the very website you are being with presented with. After signing up for this event, we got to work brainstorming ideas, designing, and programming. We eventually came up with a simple system of three pages: a homepage, a registration page, and a gallery for the items. Using a combination of HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, we were able to create a rather basic, functional lost and found site connecting said pages. This site eventually came to be known as: V1.</p>
   <br>
   <br>
   <br>
   <img class="V1pics" src="V1 Homepage.png" alt="V1 Homepage" width="100%">
   <br>
   <br>
   <p> The initial homepage came with a small yet warm welcome with a description, the most primitive version of the navigation bar, and the most patriotic image of the school we could find.</p>
   <br>
   <br>
   <img class="V1pics"  src="V1 Registration.png" alt="V1 Registration" width="100%">
   <br>
   <br>
<p>The registration page had many fields, some admittedly more unnecessary than others, and some solid-looking stylization.</p>
   <br>
   <br>
   <img class="V1pics"  src="V1 Gallery.png" alt="V1 Gallery" width="100%">
   <br>
   <br>
<p>The gallery prototype shown above is similar to the homepage, with its warm welcome and description. How it worked, though, was easily the most unique part of the website. After an item was registered, anybody could 'claim' it. It'd give you a message, telling you to go claim it at the front office. Despite you 'claiming' it, the entry wouldn't go away from the website until the item was given away. This meant all 'claiming' an item did was telling you to go to the front office. While it all worked, it definitely meant the system was weak. That's why we decided to change it.</p>
   <br>
   <br>
   <p>To recap: at the time, the site was functional, but rather basic. After getting various feedback from our judges at the Area V competition, and thankfully getting the opportunity to present at our state's leadership conference, we got to work improving the website.</p>
   <br>
   <br>
 <p>At the forefront of this redesign was accessibility. We polished the interface, adding the navigation bar at the top, allowing you to access any part of the website from wherever you are. We also polished up the design by implementing design principles not present in V1. The registration process has also been reworked to eliminate any unnecessary fields,  the gallery search engine has been refined, and the claim process has been completely redone. There also comes new additions, such as the implementation of the feedback page, an archive of every item ever registered, and the instructional video on how to use the site. All of this and more comes in the new and improved:</p>
